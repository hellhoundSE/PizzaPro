The essence of the subject is to create a web application for pizzeria using ASP.NET

Here is list of business requirements: 

In this case, we want to design a pizza ordering application. Pizza restauarant owners came to us because they would like to increase   sales of their products, and especially increase the number of online orders.

In the current system, users have trouble finding the most important options that interest them. In addition, the pizzeria often introduces various types of extras and promotions that are difficult to find on the website.

We would like the pizza ordering process to be interesting and to attract the attention of users in some way. Due to the location of the premises, a large proportion of customers are students as well as families (especially on weekends).

We would like users to be able to easily find pizza with ingredients that interest them. In addition, we also want them to have a convenient way to design their own pizza with their ingredients of their liking. Users also complain about the order process and unspecified waiting time for the given order. We want to specifically let you know where the pizza delivery person is and when it will reach us.

The application should include ordering any number of pizzas, toppings and finalizing the order, i.e. payment online (by card) or on delivery.
